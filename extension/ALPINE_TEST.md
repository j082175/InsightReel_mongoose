# Alpine.js Migration Test

## Files Created
- ✅ `popup/alpine.bundle.js` - Alpine.js framework bundled for Chrome Extension
- ✅ `popup/popup-alpine.html` - New Alpine.js-based popup HTML
- ✅ `popup/popup-alpine.js` - Alpine.js reactive controller logic
- ✅ `build-alpine.js` - Build script for bundling Alpine.js

## Manifest Updated
- ✅ Changed `"default_popup": "popup/popup.html"` to `"popup/popup-alpine.html"`

## Improvements Made
- **Reactive Data Binding**: Settings toggles automatically sync with state
