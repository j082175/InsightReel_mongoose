# Legacy Controllers Archive

This directory contains backup files from the pre-SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) architecture.

## Files Moved Here:

### Main Legacy Controller
- **video-controller.ts.backup** (1,262 lines)
  - Original monolithic controller handling all video operations
  - Split into focused controllers: VideoProcessController, VideoQueryController, SystemStatsController, AdminController

### Legacy Backup Files
- **video-controller.old.js.backup**
  - JavaScript version of the original controller

### Legacy Entry Points
- **index.old.js.backup**
  - Old server entry point using the monolithic controller
- **index-new.js.backup**
  - Intermediate server entry point during migration

## Current Active Architecture (SRP-compliant):

The monolithic `VideoController` has been successfully split into focused controllers:

1. **VideoProcessController** - Video processing operations (`/process-video`, `/upload`)
2. **VideoQueryController** - Video querying and retrieval (`/videos`, `/videos/:id`)
3. **SystemStatsController** - System statistics (`/stats`)
4. **AdminController** - Admin operations (`/update-headers`)
5. **Direct routes** - Simple endpoints implemented directly in routes (`/add-url`)

## Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETE

- **TypeScript Migration**: 100% complete
- **SRP Refactoring**: 100% complete
- **Dead Code Cleanup**: 100% complete
- **Server Status**: Running successfully with new architecture

These files are kept for reference but are not used by the current application.
